# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is currently not compatible with SWC. See [this issue](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/issues/428) for tracking the progress.

## Maintenance Mode

The application includes a built-in maintenance mode feature that can be enabled by setting the `VITE_MAINTENANCE_MODE` environment variable.

### How to Enable Maintenance Mode

1. Open the `.env` file in the project root
2. Set the maintenance mode variable:
   ```env
   VITE_MAINTENANCE_MODE=true
   ```
3. Restart the development server or rebuild the application

### Accepted Values

The following values will enable maintenance mode:
- `true`
- `1`
- `yes`

Any other value (or unset) will keep the application in normal mode.

### Features

When maintenance mode is enabled:
- All users see a professional maintenance page instead of the application
- The page includes a countdown timer that auto-refreshes every 5 minutes
- Users can manually check status with a refresh button
- Contact information is provided for urgent inquiries
- The page maintains the app's design theme and branding

### Disabling Maintenance Mode

To return to normal operation:
1. Set `VITE_MAINTENANCE_MODE=false` or remove/comment out the variable
2. Restart the development server or rebuild the application

## Cloudflare Deployment With Wrangler

This app can be deployed to Cloudflare as a static-assets Worker using Wrangler. The app uses `BrowserRouter`, so the Wrangler config includes SPA fallback handling for deep links such as `/notifications` or `/user/:userid`.

### 1. Prepare environment variables

Create or update your local `.env` file using `.env.example` as the template.

Required variables:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_KEY`
- `VITE_SITE_URL`
- `VITE_REACT_APP_GEOAPIFY_API_KEY`

Recommended for Cloudflare:

- Set `VITE_SITE_URL` to your final Cloudflare URL, for example `https://meetcutes.your-subdomain.workers.dev`

### 2. Authenticate Wrangler

```bash
npm run cf:whoami
```

If you are not logged in yet, run:

```bash
npx wrangler login
```

### 3. Preview locally with Cloudflare

```bash
npm run cf:preview
```

This builds the Vite app and serves it through Wrangler using the config in `wrangler.toml`.

### 4. Deploy

```bash
npm run cf:deploy
```

That command:

- builds the app into `dist`
- deploys the built assets with `wrangler deploy`
- enables SPA fallback so client-side routes work after refresh

### 5. Optional custom domain

After the first deployment, you can attach a custom domain from the Cloudflare dashboard or extend `wrangler.toml` with routes for a zone you control.

### Notes

- `public/sw.js` is deployed as a static asset and will continue to work in production.
- Because this app is built by Vite, all `VITE_*` values must exist before running the build command.
- If you change `VITE_SITE_URL`, rebuild and redeploy so auth redirect URLs stay correct.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
